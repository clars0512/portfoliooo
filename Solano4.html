<br> It's teachers day! We held a program inside the classroom. 
<br> We had games, dances, and surprises, all with some teachers joining us. <br> It was a very fun day. <3  
<br> <br> <br>
Our theme for the program was Olivia Rodrigo, <br> so we had purple outfits and face stickers, inspired by the singer's albums. </p>

We had a Christmas party before we entered our break. We held another program. There were different kinds of games and dances. We also celebrated with the other teachers. 
<br><br><br><br>
The most exciting part for me was the Exchange Gift giving part. <br> I gave my gift to Ashley, and she loved it very much.  <br> Meanwhile, Jacob gave me what I wanted: color pencils!! (THANK YOUUUUUU) <br> Everyone else received their gifts, and were happy from the surprises. 
<br> <br> Also, our theme for the program was Barbie. So, the girls wore pink while the boys blue.</p>

So the first half of the school year is over. I went through many quizzes, <br> performance tasks, and activities. I can say I am already enjoying Grade 9. <br> I wish to see more exciting things during the second half, which is 3rd - 4th quarter. </p> <br>

<p class="blog3"> April 4, 2024 <br> Another unforgettable experience. <br> For our ESP class, we held a variety show for Women's Month. <br> Tons of preparations were made for this, and I am glad it turned out very nice.  <br> We performed dances, songs (even original ones), and other fun stuff. </p>

I posted this blog because this actually kind of memorable. <br> During the school year, we were tasked in AP to do an interactive notebook for every quarter. <br> I remember starting making them early, but I still had to also cram it in school minutes <br> before passing it. (look how thick my notebooks are)

<p class="blog3"> May 10, 2024 <br> So we are nearing the end of our Grade 9. I can say that I enjoyed a lot of my time. <br> I experienced many new things, faced challenges and fears, and had fun. <br> I want to say thank you for making this Grade 9 wonderful and memorable. I appreciate every moment of it. I will now prepare to enter Grade 10. <br>
